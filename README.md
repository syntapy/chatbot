# Install / run

After cloning, put your [OpenAI](https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys) api key in `.apikey`, just plain without anything else

Example if your api key is `key-12345678910`, that should be the entire contents of `.apikey`

Then do

```
npm install
npm run build
npm run start
```

The last cmd will start a dev server on port 3000 and open a browser tab to that
